 <Password-Generator-by-MYR>

For this password generator I tried to utilize some of the newly introduced tools from JavaScript.  Unfortunately I've run into several issues with code that prevent the generator from working properly.  Although the application is quite simple it seems to be relatively easy to fall into problems trying to meet certain criteria.  It's interesting and motivating to realize that the inner workings of a site can be very complex and practically invisible to the average user.
